At **SignalMind Lab**, our research explores how signals — whether embedded in medical imaging data, wireless propagation environments, IoT sensor networks, or complex biological and financial systems — are perceived, processed, and transformed into meaningful insights for decision-making. We study the intersection of signal processing, deep learning, and explainable artificial intelligence, seeking to understand how information flows across telecommunications infrastructure, diagnostic systems, industrial networks, and intelligent applications that connect data to discovery.

To date, Dr. M. A. Samad has authored or co-authored over 59 peer-reviewed publications across high-impact venues such as Cancers, IEEE Access, Scientific Reports, Sensors, PLOS ONE, and Journal of Big Data. His works span from explainable deep learning and signal modeling to complex systems analysis and communication networks, reflecting a broad pursuit of understanding signals in their many forms.

Our goal at SignalMind Lab is to connect the mathematical, computational, and perceptual dimensions of signal interpretation — creating pathways toward more adaptive, explainable, and human-aligned intelligent systems.
